The green circle looking shape indicates the start and end of the recipe.
Begin by starting at the start line.
Follow the steps from 1 down to 6.
Below step 6 you will see a circle with the letter A inside. You will need to find the second circle on the top right hand side of the next column.
Continue to follow step 7 to 10.
On step 11 you will find a choice question on whether or not you like rice. This question gives you 2 options on whether you do like rice or if you don't. 
If you do like rice you would follow the yes arrow and go to step 12. If you don't like rice you would follow the no arrow and go to step 13 where noodles are another option for you.
Following the next arrow down you will need to pass through a circle with the letter B inside. Ignore this circle it is a connector. 
Continue to follow the next arrow to step 14.
You have now completed making the Stir fry congratulations.
